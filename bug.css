The CSS property `calc()` is used incorrectly, resulting in unexpected behavior or rendering issues.  For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` within a nested element might not subtract correctly if the parent element doesn't have its dimensions explicitly set.  Another example: Incorrect order of operations within a `calc()` expression can lead to unintended results.
